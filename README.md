## ChatBot-Chromadb-together.ai-Llama-2-70b

## Overview
The ChatBot-Chromadb-together.ai-Llama-2-70b project is an implementation of a chatbot powered by the Llama-2-70b language model developed by together.ai. This chatbot is designed to interact with users conversationally, providing answers to their questions, delivering information, and offering support across various domains. By leveraging a Chromadb database, the chatbot is capable of responding to specific queries related to topics such as molecular biology, genomics, and other biological domains. The Llama-2-70b model is renowned for its high performance in text generation, enabling the chatbot to offer accurate and informative responses to users. This project aims to provide a rewarding and useful user experience by employing advanced natural language processing techniques and cutting-edge machine learning technologies.
